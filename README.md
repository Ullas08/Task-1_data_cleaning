📊 Task 1 – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

🏢 Internship Task: This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship. The objective was to clean and preprocess a raw dataset to make it analysis-ready.

📁 Dataset Used: Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset: Total records: 8807, Total columns: 12

The dataset contains information about Netflix titles including: Show ID, Type (Movie/TV Show), Title, Director, Cast, Country, Date Added, Release Year, Rating, Duration, Genre (listed_in), Description

🎯 Objective: To perform real-world data cleaning by: Identifying missing values, Handling null entries, Removing duplicates, Converting incorrect data types, Standardizing dataset structure

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps Performed:

1️⃣ Handling Missing Values: Filled missing director values with "Unknown", Filled missing cast values with "Not Available", Filled missing country using mode value, Converted date_added column to datetime format, Remaining minimal missing values in rating (4) and duration (3) were retained as they were insignificant

2️⃣ Removing Duplicates: Checked for duplicate rows, Removed duplicates using drop_duplicates(), Final duplicate count: 0

3️⃣ Data Type Conversion: Converted date_added from object → datetime64[ns], Ensured release_year is integer type

4️⃣ Final Dataset Summary:

Metric	Value
Initial Records	8807
Final Records	8797
Duplicate Rows Removed	0
Cleaned Date Format	Yes
Major Missing Values Handled	Yes
🛠 Tools Used: Python, Pandas, VS Code

📌 Key Learnings: Handling real-world missing data, Fixing inconsistent date formats, Avoiding chained assignment warnings, Writing cleaner and safer Pandas code, Making datasets analysis-ready

🚀 Outcome: The dataset is now clean, structured, and ready for further analysis or visualization.

📂 Files Included: Task_1.py – Python script for cleaning, cleaned_netflix_dataset.csv – Final cleaned dataset, Screenshots of execution output
